## II. FantasyGamefi project and design framework introduction

Fantasy is currently an online Casino Web2 game with tens of thousands of DAU（Daily Active Users), along with very good user stickiness and sustainable income. 



The future direction of the project is divided into the following two parts, one is the game itself, the other is the economic model. 



In terms of the game itself, Fantasy's current casino games are mainly Slot games. In the coming months, other types of casino games （Teen Patti，Rummy，Bingo，Texas Poker etc）will be added one after another to enrich players' gaming experience. After the completion of Casino Game City, Fantasy plans to expand the boundaries of the game to the other area such as Fantasy Sport，Casual Game，Online Earning Game to provide players with a diversified game world.



As for economic model, Fantasy will be gradually transformed into FantasyGamefi, positioned in Web2.5 with intervention of NFT and Token, which aims not only to attract users from Web3 world, but also to bring more transparent and preferential user referral commission mechanism through NFT, and open up the economic activities of each game within Fantasy Ecosystem through Token. It is a relatively a "bold" attempt for both project itself and the players.



The NFT-related part of this white paper is mainly for the design and issuance of Casino game NFT, and if there is any difference in the issuance mechanism of other game (Sport/Casual) NFT in the future, it will be added in the white paper accordingly. Equity tokens are unique within the whole FantasyGamefi ecosystem, and will not be issued differently depending on the game, thus the token section of the white paper will represent the entire FantasyGamefi tokenomics design.



The overall framework of the game is as follows.

NFT + off-chain points + on-chain equity tokens + BAAS  platform. A brief description of each element is as follows and will be explained in further detail below.

* NFT - Holders enjoy a higher percentage and more transparent on-chain referral commissions, NFT is also Upgradable.
* Off-chain points - system contribution value, similar to the traditional MMORPG DKP system, points are not tradable, but can be used to auction NFT.
* On-chain equity tokens - used to participate in governance, get off-chain points, upgrade the NFT commission ratio and layer, Token Staker get Web3 player’s （Users who deposit using Crypto instead of Fiat) system revenue share.
* BAAS (Blockchain as a service) - The system uses the most up to date BAAS platform to automatically create on-chain addresses and private key escrow for each Web2 user. Users can perform corresponding Web3 on-chain operations through the Web2 interface, avoiding the “Well Known Barrier” of helper words, private key storage, etc., making the user's Web3 experience a smooth and seamless transition from Web2.
