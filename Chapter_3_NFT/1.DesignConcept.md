### 1. Design Concept 

Under the circumstance that the game itself already has a single-level referral commission rate at the Web2 end, the introduction of NFT can create a deeper level of attraction for players interested in promoting & referral. 



NFT referral mechanism has the following advantages compared to Web2 version. 

* In-Game Giftpack & VIP Privilege.
* Higher commission rate.
* Upgradable commission rates and tiers.
* Future token airdrop. 
* More transparent commission on-chain - all in USDC.
* A new experience for those who have not experienced the Web3 world.
* Fun MMORPG-like DKP auction systemB.
* Blind box experience - Some Non-recruiting new users will be randomly associated to a random NFT for referral commission.
* Collection value of NFTs based on their rarity.
