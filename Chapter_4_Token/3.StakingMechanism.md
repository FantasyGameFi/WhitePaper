### 3. Staking Mechanism

Users who stake tokens are entitled to a share of the system's profits from players who top up their cryptocurrency in the system. The staking requires a lock-in period of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to receive the corresponding percentage of VeFANTASY (refer to Curve staking model). The governance authority and the percentage of dividends will depend entirely on the number of VeFANTASY held by the user.
