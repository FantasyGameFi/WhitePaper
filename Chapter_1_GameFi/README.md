## I. Some thought about the current Gamefi

As we all know, Play2Earn is the most popular Gamefi model in Web3 world. 

Although the Gamefi 1.0 represented by Axie has various problems, such as excessive incentive, low playability, and the death spiral of token price caused by “Ponzi tokenomics”, it undoubtedly provides an underlying design idea for the future Web3 world game design - that is, to make players participating through a certain level of incentive, to get them more involved, to better satisfy their needs, and to expand the total time and LTV of the player base. 

More importantly, with Web3 elements added into game, players now have opportunity to pass the value created back to themselves, and many of the opaque or black-box operations of the Web2 era can be solved by the transparency of blockchain. By partially absorbing the favorable design parts of Web3 Gamefi and avoiding over-incentives, FantasyGamefi aim to transform itself to a Web2.5 mode, in the form of Web2+Web3. 

Based on the current circumstance that blockchain infrastructure is in its very early stage, and blockchain-native games were just starting, we believe this Web2.5 Gamefi style will have a fairly long duration and necessity of its existence - that is, "taking off the Web3 part with tokens and NFT, the game can still run well independently with high playability and user activity. With the addition of To Earn” attribute of Gamefi, the tokens and NFT act as a boost and reinforcement for the game and players, instead of Play2Earn mechnism taking over the core elements of the game. This definitely could avoid the “Doomed death spiral” of Axie, Stepn and many other first generation P2E Gamefi.
